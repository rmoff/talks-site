<p>Companies new and old are all recognising the importance of a low-latency, scalable, fault-tolerant data backbone, in the form of the Apache Kafka streaming platform. With Kafka, developers can integrate multiple sources and systems, which enables low latency analytics, event-driven architectures and the population of multiple downstream systems.</p>
<p>In this talk, we’ll look at one of the most common integration requirements - connecting databases to Kafka. We’ll consider the concept that all data is a stream of events, including that residing within a database. We’ll look at why we’d want to stream data from a database, including driving applications in Kafka from events upstream. We’ll discuss the different methods for connecting databases to Kafka, and the pros and cons of each. Techniques including Change-Data-Capture (CDC) and Kafka Connect will be covered, as well as an exploration of the power of ksqlDB for performing transformations such as joins on the inbound data.</p>
<p>Attendees of this talk will learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>why events, not just state, matter</li>
<li>the difference between log-based CDC and query-based CDC</li>
<li>how to chose which CDC approach to use</li>
</ul>
