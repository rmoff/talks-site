Oracle Big Data Spatial and Graph enables the analysis of datasets beyond that of standard relational analytics commonly used. Through Graph technology relationships can be identified that may not otherwise have been. This has practical uses including in product recommendations, social network analysis, and fraud detection.

In this presentation we will see a practical demonstration of Oracle Big Data Spatial and Graph to load and analyse the "Panama Papers" dataset. Graph algorithms will be utilised to identify key actors and organisations within the data, and patterns of relationships shown. This practical example of using the tool will give attendees a clear idea of the functionality of the tool and how it could be used within their own organisation.
