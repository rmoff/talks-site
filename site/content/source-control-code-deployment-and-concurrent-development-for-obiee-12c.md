The use of source control should be seen as mandatory in any software development project. It enables rapid audit and rollback of changes made, as well as being the mandatory foundation for more advanced development methods involving multiple concurrent developers. In this session we will look at options for integrating OBIEE 11g and 12c (including the new .bar format) with source control tools including Subversion and Git, focusing on Git as our preferred SCM tool. We will look at how Git can be used to provide the foundations of a robust and powerful concurrent method for OBIEE, and compare it to other options including MUDE and use of MDS XML.
