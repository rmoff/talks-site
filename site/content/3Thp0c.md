<p>Apache Kafka is a de facto standard streaming data processing platform, being widely deployed as a messaging system, and having a robust data integration framework (Kafka Connect) and stream processing API (Kafka Streams) to meet the needs that common attend real-time message processing. But there’s more!</p>
<p>KSQL is a declarative, SQL-like stream processing language that lets you easily define powerful stream-processing applications. What once took some moderately sophisticated Java code can now be done at the command line with a familiar and eminently approachable syntax.</p>
<p>Filtering one stream of data into another, creating derived columns, even joining two topics together—it’s all possible with KSQL. Come to this talk for a thorough overview of KSQL. There’ll be plenty of live coding on streaming data to illustrate clearly KSQL’s awesome power!</p>
