Do better OBIEE development and deliver it more rapidly! Just because OBIEE is presented to users through a web browser that doesn't mean the regression testing has to take place there too. This presentation will demonstrate how you can efficiently and effectively test the bulk of changes made to your system without going anywhere near the front end. With hands-on examples of the tools involved -- including the Baseline Validation Tool that ships with OBIEE 12c -- this will be a practical presentation giving anyone interested in the topic a headstart in implementation.
