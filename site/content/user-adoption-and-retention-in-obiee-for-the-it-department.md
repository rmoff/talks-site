Build it, and they will come! Maybe. But maybe they won't stay very long, and maybe they'll never return...and you may never know. Your users are the most valuable part of your OBIEE system; without an active and engaged user base an OBIEE deployment is doomed to wither and die, to join the scrap heap of many a failed BI project. But it doesn't have to be that way!

In this talk I will discuss how we can measure user engagement, collect performance metrics, and most importantly see how to action this information in order to proactively work with users to ensure the system is meeting their needs in terms of performance, functionality and data. The core data source for all of this is OBIEE's Usage Tracking, and we will also discuss how log files can be configured and mined in order to provide an additional rich source of data.
