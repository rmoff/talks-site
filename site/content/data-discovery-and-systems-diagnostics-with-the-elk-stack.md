The suite of tools made up of Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana (ELK) offers a powerful and flexible way with which to explore and analyse data. Whether log file or streamed, batch or realtime, system or business data - ELK makes it easy to ingest and analyse. This presentation will use the tools to both demonstrate the systems monitoring and interactive diagnostic capabilities that ELK gives, as well as how it can be used for data discovery against "Big Data" from a variety of sources including Hadoop. With live demos, we'll explore what the ELK components are, the options to ingest data, and the powerful visualisation and search capabilities provided.
