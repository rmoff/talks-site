<p>Have you ever thought that you needed to be a programmer to do stream processing and build streaming data pipelines? Think again!
Apache Kafka is a distributed, scalable, and fault-tolerant streaming platform, providing low-latency pub-sub messaging coupled with native storage and stream processing capabilities. Integrating Kafka with RDBMS, NoSQL, and object stores is simple with Kafka Connect, which is part of Apache Kafka. ksqlDB is the event streaming database for Apache Kafka, and makes it possible to build stream processing applications at scale, written using a familiar SQL interface.</p>
<p>In this talk, we’ll explain the architectural reasoning for Apache Kafka and the benefits of real-time integration, and we’ll build a streaming data pipeline using nothing but our bare hands, Kafka Connect, and ksqlDB.</p>
<p>Gasp as we filter events in real-time! Be amazed at how we can enrich streams of data with data from RDBMS! Be astonished at the power of streaming aggregates for anomaly detection!</p>
