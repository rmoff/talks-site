<p>Have you ever thought that you needed to be a programmer to do stream processing and build streaming data pipelines? Think again! Apache Kafka is a distributed, scalable, and fault-tolerant streaming platform, providing low-latency pub-sub messaging coupled with native storage and stream processing capabilities. Integrating Kafka with RDBMS, NoSQL, and object stores is simple with Kafka Connect, which is part of Apache Kafka. KSQL is the open-source SQL streaming engine for Apache Kafka, and makes it possible to build stream processing applications at scale, written using a familiar SQL interface.</p>
<p>In this workshop you will learn the architectural reasoning for Apache Kafka and the benefits of real-time integration, and then build a streaming data pipeline using nothing but your bare hands, Kafka Connect, and KSQL.</p>
<p>Gasp as we filter events in real time! Be amazed at how we can enrich streams of data with data from RDBMS! Be astonished at the power of streaming aggregates for anomaly detection!</p>
