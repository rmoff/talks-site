Apache Kafka is a streaming data platform enabling enterprise data integration with built-in stream processing. Kafka Connect, part of Kafka since version 0.9, provides an API that enables the integration of data from multiple sources, including MQTT, common NoSQL stores, and CDC from relational databases such as Oracle.

The presentation demonstrates how to leverage change-data-capture to enable event-driven architectures without modifying existing applications. It covers connectors for sources and targets like HDFS, S3, and Elasticsearch, along with Single Message Transform (SMT) capabilities introduced in Kafka 0.10.2 for enhanced flexibility in building production data pipelines.
