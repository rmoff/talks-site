<p>Detecting fraudulent activity in real time can save a business significant amounts of money, but has traditionally been an area requiring a lot of complex programming and frameworks, particularly at scale. Using KSQL, it’s possible to use just SQL to build scalable real-time applications.</p>
<p>In this talk, we’ll look at what KSQL is, and how its ability to join streams of events can be used to detect possibly fraudulent activity based on a stream of ATM transactions. We’ll also see how easy it is to integrate Kafka with other systems—both upstream and downstream—using Kafka Connect to stream from a database into Kafka, and from Kafka into Elasticsearch.</p>
