Are you involved in the design and development of OBIEE systems and want to know the best way to go about ensuring good performance? Maybe you've an existing OBIEE system with performance "challenges" that you need to diagnose?

This presentation looks at the practical elements of diagnosing the causes of performance issues in OBIEE, and discusses good practices to observe when developing new systems. It includes discussion of OBIEE 12c and with additional emphasis on analysis of Usage Tracking data for the accurate profiling and diagnosis of issues.
