The Exalytics appliance was launched amidst much fanfare and hyperbole, and with their purchase of their own Exalytics machine, Rittman Mead have been able to put the theory to the test. This presentation will assess whether Exalytics out of the box is a true panacea for all OBIEE deployments in all situations, or if there are use-cases in which alternative configurations or technologies may be more appropriate. Performance testing methods will be discussed, and in-depth examples from our Exalytics box examined.
